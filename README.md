# Skate Park

I made this web site to show the importance of responsiveness. Practically everyone these days has a smartphone and uses it for everything: checking email, playing games, watching videos, accessing websites, etc. Therefore, taking care of the responsiveness of your website is very important, since most people will most likely access it from their smartphone and your content has to adapt well to the different screen sizes of tablets and smartphones.

For example: Imagine that you are developing an e-commerce that will send emails with promotions to your customers. If your customer receives the email on their smartphone, they will also access the promotion link via their smartphone, instead of having to turn on their PC or notebook to do so. This is a concept used in mobile first development.

So, here's an example of an e-commerce that gives personalized skateboarding lessons to people of all ages and levels.
